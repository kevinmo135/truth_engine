**SHORT-TERM IMPACT (1-2 years):**  
In the immediate term, companies that currently own both PBMs and pharmacies will need to divest or reorganize. This could lead to some disruptions in service or increased administrative costs as adjustments are made.

**LONG-TERM IMPACT (5+ years):**  
Over the long term, the separation could foster a more competitive market for pharmacy services, potentially leading to lower drug prices and better services for federal employees. It might also set a precedent that influences broader health care industry practices.

**KEY CONTROVERSIES:**  
- One major debate is whether the prohibition of common ownership will indeed lead to lower drug prices and better transparency, as intended.
- Opponents may argue that the legislation imposes unnecessary restrictions on businesses, potentially leading to inefficiencies or increased costs.
- There may be disagreements about the impact on small businesses and whether this regulation disproportionately affects smaller integrated providers.

**COST/SAVINGS:**  
The financial impact of this legislation includes potential initial costs for companies to restructure or divest, which could be significant. However, there may be long-term savings for federal health plans if the separation leads to more competitive pricing and reduced drug costs. The exact financial effects would depend on market responses and implementation details.

**Sponsor:** Unknown

**PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY:**  
This bill proposes changes to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. It aims to ensure that federal funds provided under this Act are not used to teach or promote ideas related to gender ideology in schools.

**BENEFITS:**  
- The bill may ensure that federal education funds are used for more traditional educational subjects, which some argue can improve focus on core academic skills.
- It may appease groups who believe that discussions of gender ideology should be handled by families or communities rather than schools.

**DRAWBACKS:**

If enacted, Florida's presidential electors would be pledged to the candidate who wins the national popular vote, but this would only take effect once enough states join the agreement to comprise a majority of Electoral College votes.

**LONG-TERM IMPACT (5+ years):**  
Adoption by enough states could fundamentally change the way presidential elections are conducted in the U.S., possibly leading to greater political cohesion or, conversely, increased regional disparities in political influence.
