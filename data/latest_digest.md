### Criminal Justice Reform Act
**Sponsor:** Rep. David Wilson (R)

**PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY:**
The Criminal Justice Reform Act is designed to change how non-violent crimes are punished and to increase support for rehabilitation programs.

**WHO THIS HELPS:**
- Individuals convicted of non-violent crimes, who might receive shorter sentences or alternative forms of punishment.
- Families of those individuals, as lighter sentences may reduce the time family members are separated.
- Communities, as increased rehabilitation efforts could lead to lower recidivism rates (the likelihood of reoffending).
- Taxpayers, as potentially lower incarceration rates could reduce the cost of maintaining prisons.

**WHO THIS COULD HURT:**
- Companies or entities that rely on prison labor may see reduced availability of workers.
- Some victims’ advocacy groups may feel that justice is not adequately served with lighter sentences.
- Law enforcement agencies if they believe the changes could undermine their efforts to deter crime.

- The establishment or expansion of rehabilitation programs, requiring initial investment and adjustment.
- Potential reduction in prison populations as sentences are reassessed under new guidelines.

**LONG-TERM IMPACT (5+ years):**
- Possibly fewer people in prison for non-violent offenses, leading to reduced correctional system costs.
- Potential decrease in crime rates if rehabilitation programs successfully reduce recidivism.
- Long-term social benefits from more individuals successfully reintegrating into society and contributing positively.

**KEY CONTROVERSIES:**
- Debate over whether the reforms adequately balance public safety with the need for justice reform.
- Concerns from some sectors about the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs and their implementation.
- Political disagreements on whether the changes are too lenient or not comprehensive enough.

**COST/SAVINGS:**
- Initial costs for expanding and implementing rehabilitation programs.
- Potential long-term savings from reduced incarceration costs and lower recidivism rates.

**Sponsor:** Rep. Maria Rodriguez (D)

**PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY:**
The Education Funding Reform Act is a proposal to change how money is distributed to public schools. The goal is to make sure that all schools, no matter where they are located, receive fair and adequate funding. This means that schools in poorer areas should receive more support to ensure all students have equal access to quality education.

**WHO THIS HELPS:**
- Students in underfunded schools, especially in low-income or rural areas, as they would receive more resources.
- Teachers and staff in these underfunded schools, who may benefit from better salaries and teaching materials.
- Schools with higher needs, such as those with more students requiring special education services or English language support.

**WHO THIS COULD HURT:**
- Schools in wealthier districts that might receive less funding than they have in the past.
- Taxpayers in districts that could see increased local taxes if additional funding is needed.

**SHORT-TERM IMPACT (1-2 years):**
- Redistribution of funds leading to immediate financial adjustments in school budgets.
- Potential initial resistance from districts that experience funding cuts.
- Increased focus on aligning resources with student needs in disadvantaged schools.

**LONG-TERM IMPACT (5+ years):**
- Improved educational outcomes in historically underfunded schools, potentially reducing achievement gaps.
- A more equitable education system that provides similar opportunities for all students, regardless of their background.
- Potential economic benefits from a better-educated workforce.

**KEY CONTROVERSIES:**
- Debate over the fairness of reducing funds to wealthier districts.
- Concerns about how funding formulas are calculated and whether they accurately reflect the needs of each district.
- Opposition from stakeholders who believe local control over school funding is more effective.

**COST/SAVINGS:**
- The financial impact would depend on the specific adjustments made to funding formulas. Overall, it may require increased state funding to ensure no district faces severe cuts.
- Potential long-term savings could arise from reduced social costs due to improved education outcomes.

By addressing funding disparities, the act aims to create a more balanced and fair public education system across all districts.
